**Introduction**

This project demonstrates an end-to-end DevSecOps pipeline for a Super Mario game. It encompasses Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Security (CS), and Continuous Deployment (CD) practices to ensure code quality and security. The pipeline integrates GitHub Actions, SonarQube, Docker, Trivy, and ArgoCD, deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

---

 **Prerequisites**

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

- An active GitHub account.
- Access to a Docker Hub account.
- An Azure account with AKS set up.
- SonarQube server running (can be hosted on AWS or Azure).
- Necessary tools installed:
  - Git
  - Docker
  - kubectl
  - Helm (optional for managing Kubernetes applications)

---

**Project Overview**

This project involves several key components:

- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD workflows.
- **SonarQube** for Static Application Security Testing (SAST).
- **Docker** for containerization.
- **Trivy** for container security scanning.
- **ArgoCD** for GitOps continuous deployment to AKS.

---

 **Pipeline Architecture**

The pipeline architecture integrates the following stages:

1. **Code Commit**: Push code changes to GitHub.
2. **Build & Test**: Run unit tests and static code analysis using SonarQube.
3. **Containerization**: Build and push Docker images to Docker Hub.
4. **Security Scanning**: Scan images with Trivy for vulnerabilities.
5. **Deployment**: Deploy to AKS using ArgoCD.
